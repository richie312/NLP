"Im surprised they didnt ask him what the future of Amazon would be like after he dies  Most of the time when the founder dies so does the drive and vision  People just want to do their jobs and go home   The company stops growing and eventually stays flat until a new one takes over  His vision of  -  years into the future will never come to fruition  You can only control whats within your lifetimebr /br /ndly I wish they asked him about his future with the USPS  Why wont they deliver all of their own packages  They make promises to their customers but its the USPS that has to own up to those promises since they are the ones that deliver almost half of all of their packages  Nobody wants to be the footman to run all of these packages  Thats why people dont even go to the stores anymore  The USPS employees have been shouldering Amazons burden  Amazon pats themselves on the back but all theyre doing is dumping the hard work on the post office  And the USPS and their employees get nothing for it  If amazon is making billions why isnt the post office and their carriers enjoying any of this success in the form of fat pay checks  Isnt the real reason that Amazon doesnt have their own fleet of delivery trucks and people because theyre getting away with highway robbery making the postal service as their work mule"
"quotHe is an inspiration to other young entrepreneursquot LOL  Are their still people who believe the silicon valley narrative of if you make something great you can start a company and become big  If you are not in the club you are not going anywhere  There are millions of examples  One right off the top of my head are the CISCO founders"
